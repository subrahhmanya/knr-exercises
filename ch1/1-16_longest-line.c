/* The C Programming Language: 2nd Edition
 *
 * Exercise 1-16: Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it
 * will correctly print the length of arbitrarily long input lines, and as
 * much as possible of the text.
 *
 * Answer: The key to arbitrary limits is buffering. Using a buffer allows you
 * to tackle a problem in chunks of memory instead of all at once. It's
 * slightly more complicated, but adds usefulness to a program.
 *
 * This solution, which was contributed by Isa (ibnIrshad), follows the spec
 * exactly, by only modifying main(), unlike many other solutions on the
 * internet.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * 1. "arbitrarily long" is interpreted to mean upto the maximum size of an
 * integer on the given architechture, e.g. 2^32 unsigned on a 32-bit machine.
 * Indeed a string of that size would be larger than 4 gigabytes.
 * It is possible to deal with numbers larger than that, but it involves a great
 * deal of work abstracting away the concept of an integer, similar to
 * dynamically sized arrays.
 *
 * 2. EOF signal (Ctrl-D) must be given on an empty line
